        Please provide a minimal working example to demonstrate the bug. Begin with the 
        initialization of any necessary database objects and clearly enumerate each 
        operation carried out. Ensure that your example is as concise as possible 
        while adequately illustrating the issue. For example:
        ```python
        >>> import pynetbox
        >>> nb = pynebox.api('https://netbox.example.com', token='my-token')
        
        ```
        Note: **do not utilize the demo instance** for replicating suspected bugs,

        _Please refrain from including any confidential or sensitive 
        information in your example._
